# CP1404 Practicals

My CP1404 Repository, containing all my work done for CP1404 practicals.
My name is Eric and I am an IOT and engineering student at JCU, and I plan to become good at programming and
electronics for future projects.

## Practical work for IT@JCU CP1404

This Repository contains all my practicals done in CP1404.
My work follows the CP1404 instructions listed in the CP1404 practicals repository, located
here: https://github.com/CP1404/Practicals
My code is expected to follow the Standard Programming Patterns contained
here: https://github.com/CP1404/Starter/wiki/Programming-Patterns

During these practicals, I have learned the following about "clean code" in this subject.

- Always use Docstrings for functions and classes to identify what is being done in that function and/or class.
- If you have to repeat yourself, it probably means you need a function, or find a better way to do the task.
- Using logical namings for functions and variable to identify what the function and/or variable does without heavily
  reading and decoding the code/program.
