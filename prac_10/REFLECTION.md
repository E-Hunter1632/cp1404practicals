# Practical 10
Regarding the estimates made during the practicals, my accuracy in determining the time was near close enough with an error of about 30 minutes. 
My accuracy did not really improve during the course of the subject as I was still learning as I went, so each new task was a new challenge to undertake. 

Regarding code reviews, I have learned that when writing code reviews, I could pick up on errors that others made and as made away of those errors in the future when writing my own code. 
When being reviewed, I found it helpful in receiving feedback from someone else's eyes on ways that I could improve my code as a programmer. 

Regarding the practical tasks overall, I found them very useful in practicing Python programming and further developing my skills. 
The things I would change about the practicals if I were in charge of the subject would be to provide more steps about how the practical should be done, and maybe some more hints in some of the harder exercises. 
It would also be more beneficial if there were some more examples similar to the tasks at hand so we can have some reference material on what to do.
